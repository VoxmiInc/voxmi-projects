            <h3>Core Concept & Objective</h3>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <p>The primary objective is to democratize access to legal documentation by simplifying the creation process. This project aims to empower individuals and businesses to generate accurate, personalized, and jurisdiction-aware legal documents efficiently, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming traditional legal services.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Value Propositions</h3>
            <div class="deliverables">
                <div class="deliverable-card">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost-effective Legal Solutions:</strong> Significantly reduces the financial barrier to accessing professional legal documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong> Provides access to legal document creation from anywhere, at any time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time-saving Automation:</strong> Generates complex documents in minutes, saving users valuable time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Accuracy:</strong> AI-driven customization and template management minimize human error and ensure contextually relevant outputs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Detailed Technical Architecture</h3>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <h4>Frontend (User Interface)</h4>
                <p>The user interface will be built using a modern JavaScript framework, with a preference for **React with Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and enhanced SEO, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience. It will incorporate **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** and potentially a UI framework like Material-UI or Bootstrap for consistent design and usability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <h4>Backend/Core Logic</h4>
                <p>The core logic, including smart form processing, template management, and AI integration, will be developed using **Python with Flask or Django**. This choice facilitates seamless integration with AI capabilities. We will be **leveraging cloud AI services like Google Cloud AI Platform or AWS Comprehend** for advanced natural language processing, entity recognition, and potentially large language model (LLM) inference to customize legal clauses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <h4>Database/Data Handling</h4>
                <p>For structured data such as user profiles, document templates, and form schemas, **SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL)** will be used. **MongoDB** will provide flexible document storage for handling complex, non-relational data, including intermediate document states and possibly user-uploaded source documents. All generated files will be stored in **secure cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage**, with versioning and robust access controls. **Encryption-at-rest will be implemented for all sensitive data** to ensure privacy and compliance.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Proposed Architecture Flow</h3>
            <div class="architecture-flow">
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h5>1. User Input & Selection (Frontend)</h5>
                    <p>User accesses the platform, selects the desired legal document type, and answers a series of guided questions within the smart forms (e.g., industry, terms, parties involved).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h5>2. Template & Clause Retrieval (Backend)</h5>
                    <p>The backend system retrieves relevant legal document templates and a library of pre-defined clauses from the database based on the user's initial selections and answers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h5>3. AI-Powered Customization & Generation (Backend/AI Services)</h5>
                    <p>AI services process the user's detailed answers, apply business logic, and intelligently customize, adapt, and integrate the relevant clauses and sections into the chosen document template, ensuring jurisdiction awareness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h5>4. Document Assembly & Storage (Backend/Cloud Storage)</h5>
                    <p>The system assembles the final, tailored legal document, converts it to the required format (e.g., PDF, DOCX), and securely stores it in cloud storage, ready for user access.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-arrow">↓</div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h5>5. Review & Download (Frontend)</h5>
                    <p>The generated document is presented to the user on the frontend for review, and the user is provided with options to download the finalized, professional legal document.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Implementation Plan & Next Steps</h3>
