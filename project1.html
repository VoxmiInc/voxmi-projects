            <h2>Internal Blockchain Research App</h2>
            <p class="project-summary">
                Building a secure, in-house blockchain application for a non-profit research entity to decentralize research data, streamline collaboration, and ensure data integrity through a robust, transparent system.
            </p>

            <h3>Core Architectural Principles</h3>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <p>
                    <strong>API-First Approach:</strong> The entire platform will be built using a strict API-first methodology. This ensures all functionalities are exposed through a well-documented, secure, and robust API, providing the foundational flexibility required for future growth, integration, and consumption by both web and mobile applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Scalability & Multi-Tenancy:</strong> The architecture is designed for future scalability. It will support the seamless onboarding of multiple research organizations, allowing each to create and manage their own utility tokens for internal incentives. Voxmi will maintain the secure infrastructure, ensuring data integrity and separation for each entity.
                </p>

            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
            <div class="project-info-section">
                <p>
                    <strong>What Blockchain network shall be used to keep the gas fee less as well as provide a strong base in security, speed and liquidity?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a critical consideration. While Ethereum offers unparalleled security and liquidity, its gas fees can be high. Polygon (as a Layer 2 solution) presents a strong alternative, offering lower transaction costs and high speed while still benefiting from Ethereum's security. The final decision will depend on the specific needs for transaction finality and the operational budget of the non-profit.
                </p>
